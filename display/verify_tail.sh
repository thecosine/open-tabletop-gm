# verify_tail.sh — confirm the campaign-side session_tail.json is healthy.
#
# Usage:
#   bash verify_tail.sh <campaign-name>
#
# Exit 0 = healthy (file exists, > 50 bytes, parses as a non-empty JSON list)
# Exit 1 = unhealthy (missing, empty/[], unparseable, or wrong shape)
#
# Used by SKILL-commands.md /gm save and /gm end to detect the wipe-bug
# state before it's too late to recover. When this returns 1, the GM is
# instructed to write a canonical tail directly to disk so the next /gm load
# has working replay material.
